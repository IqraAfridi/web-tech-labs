# Lab 01 Reflection

In this lab, I learned how to use Git to keep track of my project work.  
I practiced making new files, editing them, and then adding and committing the changes in Git.  
I also learned about branches by creating a new branch, making some changes, and then merging it back to the main branch.  
It was really helpful to see how Git keeps track of changes and how I can manage different versions of my work.  
Overall, this lab helped me feel more comfortable using Git and GitHub, and I think it will be very useful for future projects.
